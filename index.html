        <p class="summary">I was always interested in economics. However until a few years ago I never really studied finance. Since I decided to change that, I have learnt finance from reading good and bad books, online courses, newspapers, blog posts and online forums and by executing trades. This post sums up and prioritizes the roadmap I recommend taking to learn about finance. Having a deep understanding of macroeconomics is not necessary to learn about finance, even less if you are only looking to manage your own money.</p>

        <p class="summary">A colleague of von Neumann and Ulam, Nicholas Metropolis, suggested using the name Monte Carlo, which refers to the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco where Ulam’s uncle would borrow money from relatives to gamble”
After studying and working with distributed systems my interests drifted into data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and now statistics. After a while I found I really liked applying what I have learnt into finance. That is how I learnt about probabilistic programming and PyMC while reading Thomas Wiecki posts at Quantopian blog.</p>

        <p class="summary">At LambdaClass and our blog This is not a Monad tutorial we are a big fans of exploring new topics, different operating systems, platforms, languages and libraries/frameworks. We have been talking in our company about exploring new subjects like protocols.
There is a whole generation of developers that has only worked with HTTP, ReST and JSON. While a partial improvement over previous technologies, it has created a protocol monoculture. There are situations where other protocols are better suited but many of the young bloods don’t even know they exist.</p>

        <p class="summary">After almost ten years of working as a developer for different companies, two years ago I started my own company LambdaClass. I did so because I wanted to have more freedom in choosing the type of projects and team I work with.
That is why today it is a very special day for me. We take a break from regular interviews and celebrate the release of our first open source application: Holiday Ping.</p>

At this point it should come as no surprise for you to learn that here at Not a Monad Tutorial we are are interested in distributed systems and Erlang. After playing a little bit with Lasp I watched a few talks by its creator: Christopher Meiklejohn.</p>

        <p class="summary">In this opportunity I interviewed Craig Kerstiens. Craig works for citusdata, a company that helps customers scale databases beyond a single node. Over the last few years, after building systems that used Redis, Cassandra, Riak, Elasticsearch and even Mongo, I rediscovered my love for PostgreSQL. The documentation is excellent, its development pace is astonishing and it is a good old reliable beast. However its feature set can be quite overwhelming. To mention just a few of its special features: you got a big option of index types (B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN and BRIN), many data types, extensions, window functions, common table expressions, foreign data wrappers.</p>

After working for almost a year with Merigo, I appreciate and understand the differences between using a BEAM language to develop a typical REST JSON system and using it to develop a videogame backend. I am not aware of many companies using Elixir to develop backends. I have only watch a talk by Jamie Winsor called “Building And Releasing A Massively Multiplayer Online Game”.</p>

        <p class="summary">Welcome back to another interview of Not a Monad Tutorial. In this opportunity I decided to interview Facundo Olano, a friend, a teammate, and a developer with a diverse experience. We talked about Python, Node.js, Clojure, Common Lisp and software development in general. Something worth mentioning is that this is not the first time Python and Clojure get mentioned together at Not a Monad Tutorial. Timothy Baldridge implemented Pixie, a Lisp language inspired by Clojure, in Python.</p>

 This time I interviewed Robert Virding, co-creator of Erlang and creator of Lisp Flavored Erlang (LFE). I am an Erlang developer and Lisp fan — if you are learning Clojure check out my post How to earn your Clojure white belt — so logically I am very excited about LFE.

That is why I want to learn so many things: new frameworks, programming languages, garbage collectors, type systems, compilers, editors, operating systems, protocols, kernel development. The road to enlightenment is long and difficult. To make things worse, you need to invest time on keeping up to date with technologies you thought you already knew.</p>

From my completely subjective point of view Red and Rebol are quite strange creatures! But don’t get me wrong, that doesn’t mean something bad. For example, I am not aware of many high-level languages which features an embedded DSL for general-purpose low-level programming or that have 50 native types.</p>

I highly recommend that you check Brian’s blog after you finish reading this interview.

_“This experience lead me to focus on building Kafka to combine what we had seen in messaging systems with the log concept popular in databases and distributed system internals. We wanted something to act as a central pipeline first for all activity data, and eventually for many other uses, including data deployment out of Hadoop, monitoring data, etc.</p>

        <p class="summary">Erlang: From zero to coding a commenting system Objective In the following series of posts we will be creating a commenting system like http://disqus.com/. The system will have normal HTTP/REST handlers but also some SSE and websockets handlers, and background jobs for uploading images to Amazon S3 and sending push notifications to iOS and Android clients via Amazon SNS. At the end of the series, we will connect Erlang and the system with other programming languages for those tasks that can be more difficult to do with Erlang.</p>

        <p class="summary">The main languages I’ve used this year My last post was a really short mention of the resources I have used to learn and develop my skills in JavaScript and Erlang. On this post I’m going to share with you some thoughts I have regarding Ruby’s present.
Ruby Oh my dear Ruby, son of Lisp, Perl, Eiffel and Smalltalk, time has passed but I think you still are such an amazing creature.</p>
