In this opportunity I decided to interview Facundo Olano, a friend, a teammate, and a developer with a diverse experience. We talked about Python, Node.js, Clojure, Common Lisp and software development in general. Something worth mentioning is that this is not the first time Python and Clojure get mentioned together at Not a Monad Tutorial. Timothy Baldridge implemented Pixie, a Lisp language inspired by Clojure, in Python.</p></div></a><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/interview-with-jesper-louis-andersen-about-erlang-haskell-ocaml-go-idris-the-jvm-software-and-protocol-design-part-ii/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-12-29 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>December 29, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Interview with Jesper Louis Andersen about Erlang, Haskell, OCaml, Go, Idris, the JVM software and protocol design - PART II</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>This is part II of the interview with Jesper Louis Andersen. You can read part I here. This part of the interview is mostly about Erlang, one of my favorite languages. If you want to learn Erlang, take a look at Spawned Shelter, a website I made for Erlang newcomers.

His blog (you should also check his old blog, you will find a lot of good things over there) and code (specially things like safetyvalve and fuse) have been a big inspiration to me. That is why I published the interview in two parts: I had too many questions for him. I hope you enjoy reading his answers as much as I did.</p></div></a><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/efene-an-erlang-vm-language-that-embraces-the-zen-of-python/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-11-27 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>November 27, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Efene, an Erlang VM language that embraces the Zen of Python</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>In this ocasion we interviewed Mariano Guerra, creator of Efene. Efene is “an alternative syntax for the Erlang Programming Language focusing on simplicity, consistency, ease of use and programmer UX”. After reading the interview with Mariano Guerra, check Efene Quick Introduction for the Busy/Lazy Programmer for learning more about Efene.

OpenBSD released its 6.0 version after 20 years of continues releases without agile, OpenSSL vulnerabilities keep on breeding, Pornhub war against ad blockers continued, the Macbook Pro is not that Pro anymore, a new javascript package manager was released by Facebook and last but not least Brexit and Trump are a reality that will shape the new world order.</p></div></a><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/how-to-earn-your-clojure-white-belt/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-09-06 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>September 6, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>How to earn your Clojure white belt</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>I tend to think that if I do not know how to implement something then I do not undestand completely how it works. That is why I want to learn so many things: new frameworks, programming languages, garbage collectors, type systems, compilers, editors, operating systems, protocols, kernel development. The road to enlightenment is long and difficult. To make things worse, you need to invest time on keeping up to date with technologies you thought you already knew.</p></div></a><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/interview-with-nenad-rakocevic-about-red-a-rebol-inspired-programming-language/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-08-28 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>August 28, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Interview with Nenad Rakocevic about Red, a Rebol inspired programming language</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>After our last interview with Brian McKenna for This is not a Monad tutorial we interviewed Nenad Rakocevic, creator of the Red programming language.
From my completely subjective point of view Red and Rebol are quite strange creatures! But don’t get me wrong, that doesn’t mean something bad. For example, I am not aware of many high-level languages which features an embedded DSL for general-purpose low-level programming or that have 50 native types.</p></div></a><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/interview-with-brian-mckenna-about-roy-purescript-haskell-idris-and-dependent-types/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-08-26 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>August 26, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Interview with Brian McKenna about Roy, Purescript, Haskell, Idris and dependent types</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>As promised in our last interview for This is not a Monad tutorial we interviewed Brian McKenna, creator of the Roy programming language. In this interview Brian talks about Roy, its implementation, how it compares with Purescript, and also about dependent types and other interesting technologies like Morte and Unison. I highly recommend that you check Brian’s blog after you finish reading this interview.
In the following weeks we will be talking with the creators of Red programming language, Robert Virding — Erlang co-inventor and Lisp Flavored Erlang creator — and with MirageOS unikernel dev team.</p></div></a><a href=https://catalinasy.github.io/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/eric-merritt-erlang-and-distributed-systems-expert-gives-his-views-on-beam-languages-hindleymilner-type-systems-and-new-technologies/ class=catalogue-item><div><time datetime="2015-08-08 00:00:00 &#43;0000 UTC" class=catalogue-time>August 8, 2015</time><h1 class=catalogue-title>Eric Merritt, Erlang and distributed systems expert, gives his views on BEAM languages, Hindley-Milner type sustems and new technologies</h1><div class=catalogue-line></div><p>In this case, This is not a Monad tutorial interviewed Eric Merritt, author of Erlang and OTP in Action, Joxa (a small semantically clean, functional lisp running on the Erlang VM), relx (best release creation tool in Erlang).
In the following weeks we will be talking with Robert Virding — Erlang co-inventor and Lisp Flavored Erlang creator — , Brian McKenna —Roy language creator— and with MirageOS unikernel dev team.

If you haven’t yet played around with Plan 9, this will make you want to do so. Be sure to check future posts because we will be keeping an eye on the development of Harvey OS, Plan 9 derivates and Plan 9 userland tools on other operating systems.
What is Harvey OS?</p></div></a></div><div class=pagination><a href=/not_a_monad_tutorial/posts/ class="left arrow">&#8592;</a>
